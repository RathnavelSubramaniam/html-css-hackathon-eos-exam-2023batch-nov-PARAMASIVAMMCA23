                Brihadishvara Temple, called Rajarajesvaram (lit. 'Lord of Rajaraja') by its builder, 
                and known locally as Thanjai Periya Kovil (lit. 'Thanjavur Big Temple') and 
                Peruvudaiyar Kovil, is a Shaivite Hindu temple built in a Chola architectural 
                style located on the south bank of the 
                Cauvery river in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India. It is one of the
                 largest Hindu temples and an exemplar of Tamil architecture. It is also
                  called Dakshina Meru (Meru of the South). Built by Chola emperor 
                  Rajaraja I between 1003 and 1010 CE, the temple is a part of the UNESCO World Heritage
                   Site known as the "Great Living Chola Temples", along with the Chola-era Gangaikonda 
                   Cholapuram temple and Airavatesvara temple, which are about
                    70 kilometres (43 mi) and 40 kilometres (25 mi) to its northeast respectively.

                The original monuments of this 11th-century temple were built around a moat.
                 It included gopura, the main temple, its massive tower, inscriptions, frescoes,
                  and sculptures predominantly related to Shaivism, but also of Vaishnavism and Shaktism.
                   The temple was damaged in its history and some artwork is now missing.
                    Additional mandapam and monuments were added in the centuries that followed. 
                    The temple now stands amidst fortified walls that were added after the 16th century.
                
                Built using granite, the vimana tower above the shrine is one of the tallest in South India.
                 The temple has a massive colonnaded prakara (corridor) and one of the largest Shiva lingas in India.
                 It is also famed for the quality of its sculpture, as well as being the location that commissioned the brass Nataraja,
                  Shiva as the lord of dance, in the 11th century. The complex includes shrines for
                   Nandi, Parvati, Murugan, Ganesha, Sabhapati, Dakshinamurti, Chandeshvara, Varahi, Thiyagarajar of Thiruvarur, Siddhar Karuvoorar and others.
                    The temple is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Tamil Nadu.</p>

                          A spectrum of dravidian temple styles continued to develop from the fifth to the ninth century
                           over the Chalukya era rule as evidenced in Aihole, Badami and Pattadakal, and then with
                            the Pallava era as witnessed at Mamallapuram and other monuments. Thereafter, between 850 and 1280,
                             Cholas emerged as the dominant dynasty. The early Chola period saw a greater emphasis on 
                             securing their geopolitical boundaries and less emphasis on architecture. In the tenth century, 
                             within the Chola empire emerged features such as the multifaceted columns with projecting square capitals.
                              This, states George Michell, signaled the start of the new Chola style. This South Indian style
                               is most fully realized both in scale and 
                          detail in the Brihadeshwara temple built between 1003 and 1010 by the Chola king Rajaraja I.

                            The Peruvudaiyar Temple is located in the city of Thanjavur, about 350 kilometres (220 mi) southwest of Chennai.
                             The city is connected daily to other major cities by the network of Indian Railways, Tamil Nadu bus services and 
                             the National Highways 67, 45C, 226 and 226 Extn. The nearest airport with regular services is Tiruchirappalli International Airport
                              (IATA: TRZ), about 55 kilometres (34 mi) away.
                              The city and the temple though inland, are at the start of the Kaveri River delta, thus with access to the Bay of Bengal and through
                               it to the Indian Ocean. Along with the temples, the Tamil people completed the first major irrigation network in the 11th century for agriculture,
                                for movement of goods and to control the water flow through the urban center.

      <h2>Architecture of Thanjavur Temple</h2>
      <img src="./img/archi.jpeg" alt="">
      <p>architectural features of the Thanjavur Temple:

        Vimana (Tower): The temple's most prominent feature is its towering vimana, which is about 66 meters (216 feet) high. The vimana is an excellent example of Dravidian architecture, characterized by its pyramid-shaped tower with intricate carvings and sculptures.
        
        Kumbam (Dome): The top of the vimana is adorned with a single granite block weighing around 80 tons, known as the Kalasha or Kumbam. It is considered an engineering marvel as it was placed on top of the vimana without the use of any adhesive.
        
        Mandapams (Halls): The temple complex consists of several mandapams or halls, each serving different purposes. The Maha Mandapam (main hall) is supported by massive granite pillars intricately carved with various deities and mythological figures.
        
        Gopurams (Entrance Towers): The temple has multiple entrance towers, known as gopurams, which are elaborately decorated with sculptures and carvings depicting various stories from Hindu mythology.
        
        Sculptures and Carvings: The entire temple is adorned with exquisite sculptures and carvings that depict scenes from Hindu epics, gods, goddesses, and mythological creatures. The level of detailing and craftsmanship is awe-inspiring.
        
        Frescoes: The inner walls of the temple once featured vibrant frescoes, although many of them have faded over centuries. These frescoes depicted various aspects of Chola culture, daily life, and religious practices.
        
        Nandi Mandapam: In front of the main shrine, there is a separate pavilion housing a massive monolithic Nandi (bull), the sacred vehicle of Lord Shiva. This Nandi statue is carved out of a single stone and is highly revered.
        
        Prakara (Enclosure Wall): The temple complex is surrounded by a high stone wall, which defines the outer boundary of the temple precincts.</p>
